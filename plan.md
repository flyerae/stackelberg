Brogram's Team Plan - Stackelberg Game
======================================

Platform
--------
* Discussed switching to JRuby but decided to stick with Java for
compatability.
* Converted Excel spreadsheet to two CSV files.

Learning the reaction funciton
------------------------------
* Assuming demand function is linear, so simply performing linear
  regression to find two variables, a and b from R(x) = a + bx.

Finding the global maxima
-------------------------
* Having estimated the follower's reaction function, R(x), we will then
  calculate our optimal strategy by maximising the (leader's) payoff function, *JL[]*.
